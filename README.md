# Fun To-do List

## Installation 




## Tech stack selection 
Below are the reasons why I chose a specific tech/tool over its alternatives 

#### Project setup 
- I didnâ€™t use Create React App mainly because I want to learn how to set up a new React project from the ground up. By doing manual setup, I was able to learn how to configure webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc along building this project. 

#### [Wouter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wouter)
- While React-Router is the current mainstream routing tool for a React project, I chose Wouter for the fact that it could achieve the same functionality in a much lighter way. Wouter has zero dependency (almost ten times lighter than React Router). And its hook-based APIs work in a way very similar to React Router. As someone who has been using React Router for a while, I was able to switch to Wouter immediately. 

#### [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)
- Redux Toolkit save developers from writing a lot of boilerplates. Plus, it uses the famous Immer library internally, which ensures developers write Redux in an immutable way. It tremendously speeds up the development
